README for a Python GitHub Repository - Neural Net Built from Scratch

Introduction:
This repository contains a neural net built from scratch using Python, without the use of any machine learning packages. The purpose of this project is to provide a clear understanding of how neural networks work and to serve as a reference for those who want to build their neural nets.

Installation:

Clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command:
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git

Navigate to the cloned repository:
cd repo-name

Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv env

Activate the virtual environment:
source env/bin/activate

Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
The neural net has been implemented in the neural_net.py file. The neural network can be configured by modifying the parameters in the __init__ method of the NeuralNet class. The neural net can be trained by calling the train method of the NeuralNet class.

The main.py file provides an example of how to use the neural net. To run the example, run the following command:
python main.py
